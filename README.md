A Clojure library designed to add dependency to your project at runtime.
It uses [alembic](https://github.com/pallet/alembic) behind the scene.

## Usage

To add new dependency to your active REPL session at runtime try

For leiningen base project, you can add the following to your `project.clj`

```clojure
:profiles {:dev {:dependencies [[net.b12n/deps "1.0.0"]]}}
```

Then from your Clojure file you can then try something like

```clojure
(require '[b12n.deps.core :refer [add-depency]]')
(require '[alembic.still :refer [distill lein load-project]])

;; Add new dependency to your session without adding it to your project.clj or deps.edn
(add-dependency :hara/io.file "3.0.12")   ;;=> nil
(add-dependency "hara/io.file" "3.0.12")  ;;=> nil
(add-dependency '[hara/io.file "3.0.12"]) ;;=> nil

;; Now use it in the project
(require '[hara.io.file :as hf])

;; Test that we can actually call the function of this library
(hf/list ".")

;; Call lein task to printout the dependency tree
(alembic.still/lein deps :tree) ;;=> see your REPL

;; To make your change permanent, you can add the above dependency to your `project.clj` or `deps.edn` file as appropriate.
;; Then run the following command in your active session.
;; See: https://github.com/pallet/alembic/blob/develop/src/alembic/still.clj#L299

;; Tips: If you are using Emacs and install clj-refactor you can use this like
;; M-x cljr-add-project-dependency
;; Then you can use this dependency permanently in your project

(load-project "project.clj")    ;;=> see your REPL
(alembic.still/lein deps :tree) ;;=> see your REPL

;; Check if we can use the new dependency
(require '[hara.io.file :as hf])
(hf/list ".")

;;=> You should see the same result as before

;; useful for check out the source
(clojure.repl/source hf/list)
(clojure.repl/doc hf/list)
```

## TODO

- Find ways to add dependency vector to `project.clj` similar to [cljr-add-project-dependency](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clj-refactor.el/wiki/cljr-add-project-dependency)
